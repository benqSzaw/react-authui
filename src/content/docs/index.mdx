## Introduction

This is set of **headless** authentication components built with:

- shadcn/ui
- react-hook-form
- zod

Ready to add via cmd or copy-paste.

## Concepts

This library is built with the following key concepts in mind:

1. **Auth Container** acts as a UI wrapper for all authentication components. It provides a consistent layout.

 2.  **Form Wrapper** simplifies the integration of **React Hook Form** with **Zod schema validation**.
Additionally, it has a loading state and root error.

 3. Inside the **Form Wrapper**, you can place form fields and buttons as children using the **Form** components from
[shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form).
